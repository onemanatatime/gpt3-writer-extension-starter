### Welcome ðŸ‘‹
This is the starter template for the [build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project. 

### **Questions?**
Have some questions make sure you head over to your [buildspace Dashboard](https://buildspace.so/p/build-ai-writing-assistant-gpt3) and link your Discord account so you can get access to helpful channels and your instructor!

### Setup Instructions

How can you test your extension quickly and easily? Check out these steps:

1. **Go to extensions** - Head to your browser and go to `chrome://extensions` (note this will be different if you are using another chromium based browser). Here you will see a list of extensions.
2. Make sure you enable developer mode on the top right.
3. **Load unpacked extension** - We are going to get our extension loaded up in our browser to actually test out! Navigate to the **root** of your project folder
4. **Let it rip** - If all went well you should see your extension in all itâ€™s glory in your list of extensions!

Note: There is no hot reloading!
So, every time you update your code, you have to go back to your [list of extensions](chrome://extensions), find yours, and pressing the refresh button on the bottom right.
If you run into problems with your extension while building make sure to refresh it! There could be changes that you write that actually never applied to your bundle yet. Sometimes, if you're noticing that your code isnâ€™t updating I recommend just deleting the extension and loading it from scratch.

- Inject directly into Google Ads to help marketers write ad copy.
- Inject directly into Twitter help users reply to DMs faster, in a more personalized way. Kinda like autocomplete on Gmail.
